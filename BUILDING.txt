AC2RD can be built from source either using Eclipse (with ADT Plugin), or Android Studio.

Prerequisites: Oracle Java JDK and Android SDK are required.

Installing Oracle Java JDK:
  - Oracle Java JDK can be downloaded here: http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html

Installing Android SDK:
  - Android SDK can be downloaded here: http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html
  - Retrieve the Android SDK version for your operating system, and install it
  - Launch Android SDK Manager

  - Select which package you want to download by selecting the checkbox and then click Install (for the AC2RD project, i select Android SDK Tools, Android SDK Platform-tools, and the SDK Platform of the latest API which is version 25, but also Android Support Repository/Library in Extras category)

Building with Eclipse (with ADT Plugin):

  - Browse and select the location of the Android SDK directory you recently downloaded and unpacked, then click Next
  - Select File > New > Project
  - Select Android Project from Existing Code, then click Next
